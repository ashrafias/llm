      "Initiate a direct proof: If we start with D, then SFS must follow it as it takes 7 hours. However, there are 11 more tasks to complete, so it's too risky to finish SFS. \n",

      "Try another sequence using inductive logic. Assume that after completing the first two tasks, D and SFS, we continue with C. This will take us 14 hours (7+4=11). The risk score is 25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assess this assumption by a proof by contradiction: If we go on to C from SFS, there would be insufficient time to complete all remaining tasks in time and within the risk limit. This means that our current sequence is incorrect. \n",
      "\n",
      "Try another sequence using deductive logic: If we start with D, then SFS, and finally C, this will take us a total of 22 hours (2+7=9) - which is just enough to complete all remaining tasks within the risk limit, and would ensure timely project completion as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "To validate our sequence, perform proof by exhaustion again: Try out all possible sequences starting with each of the first three tasks, ensuring we do not exceed our time constraint (22 hours), and maintain a risk score less than 50%.\n",
